#Important stats to potentially compile in dataset:

# Point Differential (PD)
# Time of Possession (ToP)
# Yards Differential
    # Total Yards vs Total Yards Allowed
        # Break down further into:
            # Rushing Yards vs Rushing Yards Allowed
            # Passing Yards vs Passing Yards Allowed
# Yards Per Play (YPP)
# Turnover Ratio
    # Turnovers committed vs Takeaways (INTs and FFs)
# Sacks
# Penalties and Penalty Yards
# QB Performance
# Net Yards Per Attempt (NY/A)
# Expected Points Added (EPA)
# Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA)
# Redzone Efficiency
# 3rd Down Conversion Rate
# 4th Down Conversion Rate?
# Field Goal %
    # Break down further into:
        # FG% from 30+
        # FG% from 40+
        # FG% from 50+
        # FG% from 60+? (Lower feature importance - 1/1 would be 100% but small sample size for ex.)
# Home Field Advantage - Feature Importance maybe less but still important
# Injury Rate - Kinda same ^
